## üìò Project Overview
This capstone project represents the culmination of my Computer Science degree, integrating knowledge across software engineering, secure coding, data management, and visualization.  

The **Animal Shelter Data Analytics Dashboard** is a full-stack data visualization platform built using **Python Dash**, **MongoDB**, and **Matplotlib**. It enables users to view, search, and interact with real-time data about animal rescue and adoption patterns in a secure, visually engaging format.

This project evolved from my original **CS-340 Client-Server Development** artifact ‚Äî a Flask-based CRUD system ‚Äî into a **modern interactive dashboard** that demonstrates scalability, usability, and security.

## üéØ Objectives
- Transform a static CRUD web app into a responsive, data-driven visualization dashboard.  
- Apply secure coding principles to all database interactions.  
- Integrate analytical insights through charts, filters, and real-time updates.  
- Implement modular architecture to support maintainability and scalability.  
- Showcase mastery of SNHU‚Äôs computer science program outcomes.

## üß© Original Artifact ‚Äì CS-340 Client-Server Development
**Repository:** [CS-340-12210-M01-Client-Server-Development](https://github.com/nwyrwas/CS-340-12210-M01-Client-Server-Development)

The original system was a **Flask + MongoDB** application that allowed authenticated users to perform CRUD operations for animal records.  
While functional, it lacked:
- Real-time data visualization  
- Modular architecture for reuse  
- Strong input validation and secure query handling  
- User-focused interface design

## üöÄ Enhanced Artifact ‚Äì Capstone Dashboard
The enhanced version re-engineers the original system into a modern analytics platform featuring:  
- **Dash Framework Integration** for interactive, component-based web UI  
- **Matplotlib Visualization** for dynamic adoption trend graphs  
- **MongoDB Optimization** with parameterized queries and indexing  
- **Data Security Controls** aligned with SEI CERT and OWASP standards  
- **Dark-mode UI** for accessibility and consistent professional design

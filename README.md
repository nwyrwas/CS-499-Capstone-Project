# üß† CS-499 Capstone Project: Animal Shelter Data Analytics Dashboard  

**Author:** Nicholas Wyrwas  
**Program:** B.S. Computer Science ‚Äì Software Engineering  
**Institution:** Southern New Hampshire University  
**Completion Date:** November 2025

## üìò Project Overview
This capstone project represents the culmination of my Computer Science degree at Southern New Hampshire University. It integrates concepts from software engineering, data management, secure coding, and visualization into one cohesive system.  

The **Animal Shelter Data Analytics Dashboard** is a full-stack Python web application built with **Dash**, **Flask**, **MongoDB**, and **Matplotlib**. It converts my original **CS-340 Client-Server Development** artifact ‚Äî a Flask CRUD application ‚Äî into a modern, secure, and visually dynamic analytics dashboard.  

The system allows users to:  
- Interactively view, search, and filter animal adoption data  
- Visualize outcomes by breed, intake type, and location  
- Observe adoption trends through charts and geographic mapping  
- Operate within a secure, validated, and modular architecture  

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Transform a static CRUD web app into an interactive data-driven dashboard.  
- Implement real-time visualization using Dash and Matplotlib.  
- Apply SEI CERT and OWASP secure-coding standards throughout.  
- Demonstrate software scalability and modular system design.  
- Showcase mastery of SNHU‚Äôs Computer Science program outcomes.

## üß© Original Artifact ‚Äì CS-340 Client-Server Development
**Repository:** [CS-340-12210-M01-Client-Server-Development](https://github.com/nwyrwas/CS-340-12210-M01-Client-Server-Development)  

The original artifact was a **Flask + MongoDB** CRUD web application enabling authenticated animal record management.  
**Limitations included:**  
- No real-time visualization or data analytics  
- Limited scalability and user interface design  
- Minimal validation on input fields  
- Lack of modularity and maintainable architecture  

---

## üöÄ Enhanced Artifact ‚Äì Capstone Dashboard
The enhanced version re-engineers the artifact into a professional-grade data analytics dashboard with the following improvements:  
- **Dash Framework Integration:** Interactive charts, graphs, and UI components.  
- **Matplotlib + Plotly Visualizations:** Dynamic adoption trend analysis.  
- **Leaflet Mapping:** Geospatial visualization of rescue and adoption data.  
- **Secure Database Queries:** Parameterized MongoDB access and sanitization.  
- **Refactored Architecture:** Modular MVC-like structure with reusable functions.  
- **Accessibility:** Dark-mode, responsive layout optimized for both desktop and mobile.

## üß≠ Professional Self-Assessment Summary

My academic journey at **Southern New Hampshire University** equipped me with the knowledge to design, build, and secure complex software systems.  
Through courses such as **CS-305 Software Security**, **CS-350 Emerging Systems Architecture**, **CS-405 Secure Coding**, and **CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering**, I learned to integrate security from the ground up and analyze software behavior at a low level.  

This capstone demonstrates my ability to translate academic concepts into practical solutions that reflect **industry best practices** in **data management**, **visualization**, and **DevSecOps**.  
It highlights my readiness to enter the professional field of software engineering with a solid foundation in full-stack development, system security, and scalable design.

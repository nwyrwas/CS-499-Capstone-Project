  <h2>🧭 Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
  <p>
    Throughout my academic journey at Southern New Hampshire University, I evolved from a student exploring programming fundamentals
    into a disciplined software engineer capable of designing secure, data-driven solutions from concept to deployment.
    Early in my coursework, I built small console and web applications that introduced me to logic structures, data types, and system flow.
    Over time, these foundational lessons matured into a deeper understanding of algorithms, modular design, and real-world scalability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Courses such as <strong>CS-350 Emerging Systems Architecture</strong> and <strong>CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering</strong>
    taught me to analyze systems from the inside out, bridging hardware-software integration with low-level behavior analysis.
    This knowledge later informed how I debugged and optimized complex back-end interactions within my capstone project.
    Similarly, <strong>CS-405 Secure Coding</strong> gave me the framework for preventing security flaws such as buffer overflows,
    integer errors, and input vulnerabilities. These lessons directly influenced the design decisions made while developing the
    Animal Shelter Analytics Dashboard, ensuring every database operation followed defensive programming principles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond technical growth, I also developed a professional mindset centered on ethics, accessibility, and user impact.
    Understanding that technology is meant to empower people, I learned to prioritize user experience and data transparency.
    The dashboard’s design reflects this philosophy — its dark theme, simple navigation, and instant feedback loops were all chosen
    to minimize cognitive load and promote inclusivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    This program also strengthened my collaborative and communication skills.
    Working through GitHub repositories and peer feedback prepared me for professional development environments where teamwork,
    documentation, and clear communication are essential. Each milestone built upon the last, reinforcing iterative design thinking,
    agile methodology, and version control discipline.
  </p>
  <p>
    In completing this capstone, I demonstrated my ability to unify all program outcomes:
    designing a software system from the ground up, applying algorithms for data management,
    integrating a secure database architecture, creating an intuitive interface, and documenting the process through technical writing and video review.
    The experience validated my readiness to contribute as a full-stack software engineer capable of solving real-world challenges
    with creativity, analytical rigor, and a focus on long-term sustainability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking forward, I intend to apply these competencies in roles involving full-stack or data-driven software development.
    My career goal is to continue building intelligent, ethical, and secure applications that enhance decision-making through data.
    The completion of this project and degree marks not an end but the beginning of my professional evolution — one founded on curiosity,
    continuous learning, and a commitment to engineering excellence.

  <h2>📘 Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Animal Shelter Data Analytics Dashboard serves as the culmination of my Bachelor’s program in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University.
    It demonstrates mastery across software engineering, secure coding, data management, and visualization while translating academic theory into an
    applied, production-ready system. The project transforms raw shelter data into meaningful insights that can inform decisions about adoptions,
    rescues, and community engagement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Built with Python’s Dash and Flask frameworks, integrated with MongoDB, and enhanced with Matplotlib and Leaflet,
    the dashboard allows users to search, filter, and visualize data dynamically.
    The result is a professional-grade, secure analytics platform that merges usability with technical precision.
  </p>

  <h2>🎯 Objectives</h2>
  <p>
    The primary objective was to enhance a static CRUD application from CS-340 into a fully interactive analytics dashboard.
    This meant introducing data visualizations, implementing stronger database security, and building a modular,
    maintainable architecture. Another objective was to create a professional user experience through clean design and responsive layout.
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondary objectives included integrating defense-in-depth security controls, applying algorithmic efficiency to database queries,
    and following UI/UX best practices. Each goal aligns directly with SNHU’s program outcomes, ensuring that the final product
    not only meets academic standards but also reflects industry expectations for full-stack developers.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>🧩 Original Artifact – CS-340 Client-Server Development</h2>
  <p>
    The starting artifact originated from the CS-340 Client-Server Development course.
    That project implemented a Flask-based CRUD web service connected to MongoDB, enabling basic operations for animal data management.
    While functional, the original version had several limitations: it lacked real-time visualization, contained minimal security controls,
    and had limited scalability. The design was primarily procedural and not yet modularized for large-scale extension.
  </p>
  <p>
    These constraints made it an excellent foundation for enhancement.
    The goal was to transform a working but rudimentary prototype into a sophisticated analytical environment with secure coding practices,
    strong visual presentation, and interactive elements suitable for non-technical users such as shelter staff or data analysts.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>🚀 Enhanced Artifact – Capstone Dashboard</h2>
  <p>
    The enhanced dashboard introduces significant architectural, functional, and design improvements.
    By integrating Dash, I restructured the application into a component-based model that reacts to user events
    through callback functions and dynamic rendering. Matplotlib powers graphical output,
    while Dash Leaflet provides geographic mapping of animal rescue data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Security and performance were central enhancements. I implemented parameterized MongoDB queries to mitigate injection vulnerabilities,
    optimized aggregation pipelines to reduce query time, and separated application logic into distinct modules for maintainability.
    The user interface now features a dark theme that emphasizes accessibility, readability, and professionalism.

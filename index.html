  <h2>🧭 Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
  <p>
    My journey through Southern New Hampshire University has shaped me from a student learning programming syntax into a capable software engineer
    skilled in problem-solving, system architecture, and secure application development. Each course built upon the last,
    teaching me not only how to code but how to design, test, and secure systems that align with real-world software engineering standards.
  </p>
  <p>
    The integration of multiple disciplines — including <strong>CS-350 Emerging Systems Architecture</strong>, 
    <strong>CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering</strong>, and <strong>CS-405 Secure Coding</strong> — gave me the foundation to approach challenges 
    methodically. In these courses, I gained proficiency in embedded systems, binary analysis, and defensive programming strategies.
    These technical experiences allowed me to develop a comprehensive understanding of both high-level and low-level system interactions, 
    which directly informed my work on this capstone project.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project required not only coding but also creativity, research, and self-direction — qualities that reflect professional readiness.
    The emphasis on <strong>secure coding</strong> guided my decisions to implement parameterized queries, validation checks,
    and modular design patterns to prevent vulnerabilities and promote maintainability.
    <strong>Data visualization</strong> required balancing functionality and performance while adhering to ethical and usability principles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Collaborating through GitHub taught me how to manage repositories, maintain documentation, and version control complex systems.
    Every milestone was approached like a sprint, with objectives, documentation, and reflection — simulating an agile workflow.
    I also strengthened my ability to communicate technical work effectively, demonstrated through my code review video and project narratives.
  </p>
  <p>
    This program has prepared me for the next phase of my career — to enter the workforce as a full-stack developer capable of designing intelligent, ethical,
    and secure systems. The skills gained here extend beyond syntax and frameworks; they encompass critical thinking, adaptability,
    and lifelong learning — all essential qualities in a constantly evolving field.

  <h2>📘 Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Animal Shelter Data Analytics Dashboard represents the culmination of my Bachelor’s program in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University.
    It unifies the disciplines of software engineering, secure coding, data management, and visualization into a real-world, production-ready system.
    The dashboard enables shelters and organizations to make informed decisions by visualizing adoption trends, rescue rates, and location-based insights.
  </p>
  <p>
    Built using Python’s Dash and Flask frameworks, with MongoDB as the back-end and Matplotlib for graphical analysis, the system demonstrates full-stack integration.
    The project evolved from a static CRUD application into an advanced analytics platform, applying modular software design and security-first principles.
    The interface is designed for ease of use, responsiveness, and accessibility, providing meaningful data exploration tools in an intuitive format.

  <h2>🎯 Objectives</h2>
  <p>
    The primary objective of this capstone was to transform the static CS-340 CRUD system into an interactive, secure, and analytical platform.
    The goal was to provide meaningful, data-driven insights through modern visualization techniques while maintaining strict software quality standards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Objectives included strengthening input validation, improving the user interface, optimizing MongoDB query performance,
    and implementing modular, maintainable architecture. These objectives were achieved by using Dash’s reactive components,
    Flask routing, and security policies aligned with OWASP and SEI CERT standards.
  </p>

  <h2>🧩 Original Artifact – CS-340 Client-Server Development</h2>
  <p>
    The original CS-340 artifact was a Flask-based web application that supported basic CRUD operations on a MongoDB database.
    It provided the foundation for database integration but lacked analytical tools and strong security design.
    The interface was basic, and user input validation was minimal, which presented opportunities for improvement.
  </p>
  <p>
    By enhancing this system, I demonstrated how an existing project can evolve into a robust, production-quality product
    through iterative improvement, code refactoring, and adherence to secure design principles.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>🚀 Enhanced Artifact – Capstone Dashboard</h2>
  <p>
    The enhanced version features an integrated data visualization dashboard built using Dash, Flask, and Matplotlib.
    Users can search, filter, and visualize adoption trends interactively. The MongoDB backend supports parameterized queries,
    optimized indexes, and aggregation pipelines for efficient performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The user interface was redesigned with a dark theme for better readability, accessibility, and professional presentation.
    These enhancements collectively modernized the application into an analytics platform suitable for deployment and further expansion.
